In some market segments, the softening is underway.<\/p>\n<p>If interest rates continue to rise to stem inflation, investors may hoard even more cash on the sidelines.<\/p>\n<p>In SaaS land, countless companies may face new realities. That anticipated higher-round valuation may be a bit more difficult to secure. Existing investors demand prudence. Achieving plan goals and managing unit economics may become more important.<\/p>\n<p>Are we going to see more companies preemptively implementing layoffs to preserve cash?<\/p>\n<p>I hope not. As a candidate for a new sales job, it\u2019s never easy to identify risk. But there are things to be mindful of to help mitigate it and find the best opportunities in the market today. The good news is this: building these habits will also help you interview well in any market conditions and assess companies for their long term prospects relative to your career goals.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Look for companies with compensation transparency. Businesses that share ranges are more likely to have clearly defined budgets assigned for roles. It\u2019s an indicator of financial prudence.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Pay attention to quota-to-compensation multiples. Companies spending a lot of much money on customer acquisition &#8211; and a big part of that is sales compensation &#8211; burn cash faster. And that becomes a bigger issue in a tighter market.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Find opportunities that get you truly excited. Dig into company case studies and stories. What business problems are being solved? How large is their pursuable market? What kind of outcomes do they seem to be influencing? Do they have a mission that inspires you? In what ways can you connect their success stories to work you have done? Can you relate as a consumer or in a personal capacity? (Note &#8211; this is not always immediately self-evident. Get curious about the business. Do your research.)<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Pick your non-negotiables. Be ready to return to the office, for example if you are able to do so. How important is a specific benefits portfolio versus equity or PTO policy?<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Treat each interview like a two-way street. Assess your manager for their industry knowledge, their EQ, and their general ability to inspire and coach you. Do the same thing with peer and cross-functional interviews. Do your homework before each discussion not merely to &#8220;impress the company&#8221; but to position yourself to do the best job evaluating.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Rather than merely asking &#8220;how many reps made quota last year&#8221; &#8211; of limited utility to assessing many early stage companies &#8211; ask the hiring manager to walk you through the overall hiring plan, and their general track record hiring. How quickly have new hires ramped in previous quarters, and how are they performing relative to more tenured reps? What led to this req being open today? Be context sensitive in the questions you ask.<\/li>\n<li>In final stages, ask about cash runway: the cash left over the burn rate in the business. What can they share with you here in general?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Lastly, ask about their contingency planning if the market softens even further. Have they thought about it? What\u2019s their overall confidence in the resiliency of their market given economic conditions today?<\/p>\n<p>Even if the job market remains hot, doing your diligence like this can help you prepare to assess opportunities relative to others. By preparing for potential economic tightening, great candidates are also learning how to vet companies that have the greatest potential for success.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Given market volatility and global instability, ongoing talent wars may soften soon.

Companies have learned they can hire exceptional talent at reasonable salaries while reducing overhead. Employees, no longer faced with paying exorbitant rents to live near headquarters, now have options to relocate anywhere.<\/p><p>So what\u2019s the problem?<\/p><p>While great people resides everywhere,\u00a0much of the southeast get less attention due to preconceptions and bias.\u00a0 In fact, some regions here likely offer the most promising opportunities for responsible growth.<\/p><p>Interested in talent expansion in the southeast?\u00a0 Here are 3 tips to ensure the best likelihood for success.<\/p><p>1. CHECK YOUR ASSUMPTIONS (AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS) AT THE DOOR<br \/>Ensure you put consistent process in place to guard against bias.\u00a0 Sounds simple enough right?<\/p><p>What happens when you don\u2019t recognize a candidate\u2019s university?\u00a0 How do you react when you hear a \u2018tang\u2019 in the way someone pronounces certain words? Are you projecting assumptions onto the candidate from across the Zoom?<\/p><p>After working for multiple tech startups in Nashville, I\u2019ve heard it all about the local talent pool. People here are \u201ctoo polite,\u201d slow to act, dripping in southern drawl, lacking \u201crelevant experience.\u201d These assumptions harm both employer and employee alike.<\/p><p>Also, take a look at how regional bias impacts your diversity and inclusion goals. The southeast is home to some of the most well renowned and prestigious HBCU\u2019s in America. Here we have metros like Memphis (where I grew up) with diverse and established Black American populations. Neglecting these locations may mean you are constraining your remote search to areas of the country with less of the\u00a0diversity needed to strengthen your company.<\/p><p>2. CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCENTIVES<br \/>The southeast boasts attractive grant opportunities and a relatively modest cost of living. Ensure you understand the landscape for employer and employee alike. Even if you only plan to make a modest number of hires in a certain remote region or state, you could be missing out on potential benefits available.<\/p><p>Before investing in hiring and recruitment, learn thoroughly about the partnerships and resources available to help. State, county, and chamber resources can provide guidance on grants and incentives available.\u00a0 Many regional universities have different programs available as well to help promote your company\u2019s presence to undergraduates and graduate students.<\/p><p>3. PLAN WITH PURPOSE<br \/>For all of the talk about the value of remote work in giving people opportunities to live anywhere, it\u2019s difficult to attract exceptional people in remote regions without a clear plan. Employee prospects want to understand your vision and objectives for hiring in their region, and the dependencies.\u00a0 Are you simply searching for people anywhere because your office is currently closed?\u00a0 Are you considering opening up a satellite office or temporary presence in another region?\u00a0 Do you plan to change you policies down the line to require people to live near headquarters?\u00a0 Be transparent and open in your communication at all times.\u00a0 This does not mean you need to have your hiring plan set in stone, or all of the specific details figured out.\u00a0 But it does mean you should at least have a roadmap.<\/p><p>Also, when planning, consider the wider range of benefits to concentrating your efforts on one or specific regions in the country. What does success look like? Aside from being able to access state grants that reduce your operating expenses, taking a geographical focus to your expansion can help you meet other business goals, including improving sales execution with personnel closer to your sales prospects, improving customer relationships with increased hours of operations, and achieving resiliency in the event that you decide to shut down your current headquarters.<\/p><p>Consider your vision for potential relocation opportunities for employees looking to move out from headquarters.\u00a0 You may want to get temporary or permanent office space, ensure you have a strong broker partner to guide your search efforts and give you a deep sense of the options available in the region.<\/p><p>TALENT EXPANSION \u2013 CLOSE<br \/>If you\u2019ve decided you want to focus on the southeast, that\u2019s great!
