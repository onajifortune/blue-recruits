When my boss is not sitting ten feet away in an open floor plan, I feel more empowered to make my own decisions directing my own growth. I don\u2019t have to seek guidance from peers on my lunch break. If I\u2019m experiencing stress within my company, online communities give me a place to gain a different perspective on how things ought to be.<\/p>\n<p>They have both filled the vacuum created by the decline of the office &#8211; and also accelerated its demise.<\/p>\n<p>And community organizers are not merely curious bystanders. In many cases, they are expanding their target market by proactively raising questions about our full-time work.<\/p>\n<p>The more they cause us to question the competency of internal business leaders, the greater our likelihood to invest time (and dollars) in communities external to the business.<\/p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean they are wrong &#8211; or that going back to the office will somehow restore a healthy old normal. But I would suggest that we look skeptically at those who evangelize for new loyalties (online community) over old ones. In that same vein, let\u2019s also be mindful that those calling for us to &#8220;return to the office&#8221; are not necessarily being &#8220;micro-managers&#8221; who want to restrain us. In many cases, they could simply be looking for ways to make the deepest impact on the professional development and growth of their teams.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remote work has opened up big opportunities for professionals to take ownership of their own learning and network outside of cubicle walls.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":243145,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"<p>TIPS FOR EXPANSION IN THE SOUTHEAST<\/p><p>Although 2020 has been a challenging year, the growth of remote hiring has fostered new opportunities across the country. Companies have learned they can hire exceptional talent at reasonable salaries while reducing overhead. Employees, no longer faced with paying exorbitant rents to live near headquarters, now have options to relocate anywhere.<\/p><p>So what\u2019s the problem?<\/p><p>While great people resides everywhere,\u00a0much of the southeast get less attention due to preconceptions and bias.\u00a0 In fact, some regions here likely offer the most promising opportunities for responsible growth.<\/p><p>Interested in talent expansion in the southeast?\u00a0 Here are 3 tips to ensure the best likelihood for success.<\/p><p>1. CHECK YOUR ASSUMPTIONS (AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS) AT THE DOOR<br \/>Ensure you put consistent process in place to guard against bias.\u00a0 Sounds simple enough right?<\/p><p>What happens when you don\u2019t recognize a candidate\u2019s university?\u00a0 How do you react when you hear a \u2018tang\u2019 in the way someone pronounces certain words? Are you projecting assumptions onto the candidate from across the Zoom?<\/p><p>After working for multiple tech startups in Nashville, I\u2019ve heard it all about the local talent pool. People here are \u201ctoo polite,\u201d slow to act, dripping in southern drawl, lacking \u201crelevant experience.\u201d These assumptions harm both employer and employee alike.<\/p><p>Also, take a look at how regional bias impacts your diversity and inclusion goals. The southeast is home to some of the most well renowned and prestigious HBCU\u2019s in America. Here we have metros like Memphis (where I grew up) with diverse and established Black American populations. Neglecting these locations may mean you are constraining your remote search to areas of the country with less of the\u00a0diversity needed to strengthen your company.<\/p><p>2. CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCENTIVES<br \/>The southeast boasts attractive grant opportunities and a relatively modest cost of living. Ensure you understand the landscape for employer and employee alike. Even if you only plan to make a modest number of hires in a certain remote region or state, you could be missing out on potential benefits available.<\/p><p>Before investing in hiring and recruitment, learn thoroughly about the partnerships and resources available to help. State, county, and chamber resources can provide guidance on grants and incentives available.\u00a0 Many regional universities have different programs available as well to help promote your company\u2019s presence to undergraduates and graduate students.<\/p><p>3. PLAN WITH PURPOSE<br \/>For all of the talk about the value of remote work in giving people opportunities to live anywhere, it\u2019s difficult to attract exceptional people in remote regions without a clear plan. Employee prospects want to understand your vision and objectives for hiring in their region, and the dependencies.\u00a0 Are you simply searching for people anywhere because your office is currently closed?\u00a0 Are you considering opening up a satellite office or temporary presence in another region?\u00a0 Do you plan to change you policies down the line to require people to live near headquarters?\u00a0 Be transparent and open in your communication at all times.\u00a0 This does not mean you need to have your hiring plan set in stone, or all of the specific details figured out.\u00a0 But it does mean you should at least have a roadmap.<\/p><p>Also, when planning, consider the wider range of benefits to concentrating your efforts on one or specific regions in the country. What does success look like? Aside from being able to access state grants that reduce your operating expenses, taking a geographical focus to your expansion can help you meet other business goals, including improving sales execution with personnel closer to your sales prospects, improving customer relationships with increased hours of operations, and achieving resiliency in the event that you decide to shut down your current headquarters.<\/p><p>Consider your vision for potential relocation opportunities for employees looking to move out from headquarters.\u00a0 You may want to get temporary or permanent office space, ensure you have a strong broker partner to guide your search efforts and give you a deep sense of the options available in the region.<\/p><p>TALENT EXPANSION \u2013 CLOSE<br \/>If you\u2019ve decided you want to focus on the southeast, that\u2019s great!
