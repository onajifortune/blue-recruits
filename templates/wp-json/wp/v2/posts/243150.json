The messaging typically looks something like this:<\/p>\n<ul><BR><\/p>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Getting a great job today is more \u201cabout who you know\u201d than ever before<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Everyone should post content and engage others on LinkedIn frequently<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Telling personal stories matters; get your voice heard now<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Increase your follower count and connections as a priority<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">In today\u2019s economy, developing your own \u201cbrand\u201d is the best guarantee of long-term career success<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There\u2019s some truth here. Over the past several years, some sales professionals have accelerated their growth by networking on platforms like LinkedIn and using it as a channel to build deeper relationships with potential employers and prospects. Many company leaders hire based on their networks; if talent is not working to expand relationships digitally, they risk losing out to less capable peers who invested more time in connections and reputation building.<\/p>\n<p>That said, it\u2019s possible to exaggerate the importance of networking to the job search, and also to lose sight of some other considerations.<\/p>\n<p>Appearances can be deceiving on social networks (no surprise!). Many of those with large followings who evangelize for the importance of personal branding do so, in part, because it feeds their business. In the last few years, we\u2019ve seen the rise of solopreneurs and side hustlers who make money either by selling &#8216;personal branding&#8217; services, or by promoting this as part of a service offering. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this in itself, but it raises questions about their ability to offer impartial advice on the topic.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of focusing on your personal brand as a starting point to a job search, consider defining your career narrative and future career goals.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">What business or societal challenges do you feel need to be solved more today than yesterday? Why? What companies do you see solving these problems and producing uniquely important future outcomes?<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\">Which specific business roles most excite you? Do you enjoy work to create awareness and education at the top of the funnel? Great! Perhaps marketing or sales development work might be fulfilling. Or, are you at your best when working directly with customers to achieve specific outcomes using products? Then, perhaps you want to pursue Customer Success roles.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\">Do you want to work with early-stage companies that offer opportunities to &#8216;wear multiple hats&#8217; and contribute in numerous ways? Or, would you be more fulfilled in a mature organization with structured onboarding to learn a function?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Once you have nailed the roles and types of companies you want to pursue based on your experience AND passions, you\u2019ll be in a great position to create content and build relationships digitally.<\/p>\n<p>Your &#8216;personal brand&#8217; becomes an OUTCOME of your intentional career focus, not a starting point. By approaching career networking in this fashion, you\u2019re more likely to make a deeper impact and credibly find the best career opportunities in the market today.[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Influencers frequently share that &#8220;building your personal brand&#8221; is really important to a job search today.

Companies have learned they can hire exceptional talent at reasonable salaries while reducing overhead. Employees, no longer faced with paying exorbitant rents to live near headquarters, now have options to relocate anywhere.<\/p><p>So what\u2019s the problem?<\/p><p>While great people resides everywhere,\u00a0much of the southeast get less attention due to preconceptions and bias.\u00a0 In fact, some regions here likely offer the most promising opportunities for responsible growth.<\/p><p>Interested in talent expansion in the southeast?\u00a0 Here are 3 tips to ensure the best likelihood for success.<\/p><p>1. CHECK YOUR ASSUMPTIONS (AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS) AT THE DOOR<br \/>Ensure you put consistent process in place to guard against bias.\u00a0 Sounds simple enough right?<\/p><p>What happens when you don\u2019t recognize a candidate\u2019s university?\u00a0 How do you react when you hear a \u2018tang\u2019 in the way someone pronounces certain words? Are you projecting assumptions onto the candidate from across the Zoom?<\/p><p>After working for multiple tech startups in Nashville, I\u2019ve heard it all about the local talent pool. People here are \u201ctoo polite,\u201d slow to act, dripping in southern drawl, lacking \u201crelevant experience.\u201d These assumptions harm both employer and employee alike.<\/p><p>Also, take a look at how regional bias impacts your diversity and inclusion goals. The southeast is home to some of the most well renowned and prestigious HBCU\u2019s in America. Here we have metros like Memphis (where I grew up) with diverse and established Black American populations. Neglecting these locations may mean you are constraining your remote search to areas of the country with less of the\u00a0diversity needed to strengthen your company.<\/p><p>2. CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCENTIVES<br \/>The southeast boasts attractive grant opportunities and a relatively modest cost of living. Ensure you understand the landscape for employer and employee alike. Even if you only plan to make a modest number of hires in a certain remote region or state, you could be missing out on potential benefits available.<\/p><p>Before investing in hiring and recruitment, learn thoroughly about the partnerships and resources available to help. State, county, and chamber resources can provide guidance on grants and incentives available.\u00a0 Many regional universities have different programs available as well to help promote your company\u2019s presence to undergraduates and graduate students.<\/p><p>3. PLAN WITH PURPOSE<br \/>For all of the talk about the value of remote work in giving people opportunities to live anywhere, it\u2019s difficult to attract exceptional people in remote regions without a clear plan. Employee prospects want to understand your vision and objectives for hiring in their region, and the dependencies.\u00a0 Are you simply searching for people anywhere because your office is currently closed?\u00a0 Are you considering opening up a satellite office or temporary presence in another region?\u00a0 Do you plan to change you policies down the line to require people to live near headquarters?\u00a0 Be transparent and open in your communication at all times.\u00a0 This does not mean you need to have your hiring plan set in stone, or all of the specific details figured out.\u00a0 But it does mean you should at least have a roadmap.<\/p><p>Also, when planning, consider the wider range of benefits to concentrating your efforts on one or specific regions in the country. What does success look like? Aside from being able to access state grants that reduce your operating expenses, taking a geographical focus to your expansion can help you meet other business goals, including improving sales execution with personnel closer to your sales prospects, improving customer relationships with increased hours of operations, and achieving resiliency in the event that you decide to shut down your current headquarters.<\/p><p>Consider your vision for potential relocation opportunities for employees looking to move out from headquarters.\u00a0 You may want to get temporary or permanent office space, ensure you have a strong broker partner to guide your search efforts and give you a deep sense of the options available in the region.<\/p><p>TALENT EXPANSION \u2013 CLOSE<br \/>If you\u2019ve decided you want to focus on the southeast, that\u2019s great!
