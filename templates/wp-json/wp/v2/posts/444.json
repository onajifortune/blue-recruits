Venture-backed companies start paying much closer attention to cash burn rates, preparing for scenarios where raising additional capital might be less assured. During these times, spending across the board receives a lot of scrutiny. &#8220;Every penny counts,&#8221; as the saying goes, especially when companies need to consider salary cuts or layoffs.<\/p>\n<p>When looking at the balance sheet, perhaps nothing stands out more than rental and office expenses. For companies with any excess office capacity, these can be particularly challenging to stomach. Companies lacking space for new employees, in turn, may well see remote hiring as another way to increase the workforce without spending money unnecessarily on new offices.<\/p>\n<p>On its surface, this seems reasonable. However, we suggest downturns may well furnish the most opportune time for regional expansion. After all, as noted in an McKinsey study published in the early 2000s, some of the most successful companies during the recession of the early 1990s outperformed others by investing more in acquisitions and increasing their operating expenses at precisely this time. Let\u2019s look at some of the reasons office expansion into new regions might be worth considering during an economic downturn.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Value and Flexibility During a Recession<\/h5>\n<p>Often, the very best leasing terms can be secured when demand softens. At these times, landlords and brokers may be more willing than previously to support attractive sub-lease options, flexible termination clauses, lower upfront deposit requirements, shorter lease terms, and, of course, reductions in pricing per square foot. With the range of options on market, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/08\/commercial-real-estate-could-be-in-big-trouble-even-after-this-is-all-over\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">opportunities to negotiate more favorable terms<\/a> may be stronger than ever.<\/p>\n<p>For companies prioritizing expense reductions in aggregate, opening up new offices in talent-dense, less-saturated regions can also mean substantially lower costs overall. The price per square foot for real estate in regions such as Nashville, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Orlando, and Charlotte can be as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.propertyshark.com\/Real-Estate-Reports\/2020\/03\/16\/most-expensive-office-submarkets-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">substantially less<\/a> than the costs seen in cities such as San Francisco, Boston, or New York. As companies consider scaling back rental expenses in their higher-priced technology hubs, they may want to contemplate expansion opportunities elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Risk Mitigation and Customer Readiness<\/h5>\n<p>The benefits of regional expansion go well beyond cost savings on real estate. By expanding locations, companies can reduce the risks associated with a particular location coming offline for any reason. In a post-Covid-19 world, risk management warrants more attention. Natural disasters and even geo-political turmoil can impact specific regions more than others. Recently, we\u2019ve also learned about the <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2020\/04\/12\/coronavirus-supply-chain-disruption-risk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">perils of global supply chains<\/a> too dependent on single suppliers or countries. Ensuring operational continuity requires more planning than many thought previously.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, expansion better positions businesses to be closer to the customer. This can be helpful to make it more efficient to reach customers in person and to augment digital marketing with localized brand awareness efforts. Customer support and sales teams, organized by region, can also better align their working hours with the customer. This increases net productivity without imposing unreasonable schedules on employees. Lastly, multiple offices can function as a destination to host customers as well. For organizations attentive to the lifetime value of their customers, these are all meaningful considerations. Office space still offers unparalleled utility for organizations to promote collaboration and deep relationships within and across an organization.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Expansion and Hiring<\/h5>\n<p>In a previous blog, we talked about <a href=\"\/blog\/how-tech-job-concentration-hurts-your-talent-strategy\/\">how concentration hurts talent strategies<\/a>, and these principles apply during economic downturns. By finding opportunities for expansion outside of tech hubs, companies can strengthen their foundation for responsible growth. Many less-saturated regions furnish access to exceptional and diverse talent at reasonable compensation levels. New locations can be attractive for existing employees looking for opportunities to move to more affordable locations to save money on housing. In fact, companies can, in many cases, increase employee retention levels, reduce salary expenses, and provide a higher quality of living opportunity for new employees and transplants<\/p>\n<p>Office locations offer tremendous value to support hiring and growth initiatives across a business. They provide space for collaboration between employees and face-to0-face meetings with customers. Rather than making quick decisions to reduce office exposure during a downtown, consider the opportunities to expand presence in cost-effective and responsible ways.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Companies who increase operating expenses and invest more in acquisitions during an economic downturn find success.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":6,"featured_media":445,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"<p>TIPS FOR EXPANSION IN THE SOUTHEAST<\/p><p>Although 2020 has been a challenging year, the growth of remote hiring has fostered new opportunities across the country. Companies have learned they can hire exceptional talent at reasonable salaries while reducing overhead. Employees, no longer faced with paying exorbitant rents to live near headquarters, now have options to relocate anywhere.<\/p><p>So what\u2019s the problem?<\/p><p>While great people resides everywhere,\u00a0much of the southeast get less attention due to preconceptions and bias.\u00a0 In fact, some regions here likely offer the most promising opportunities for responsible growth.<\/p><p>Interested in talent expansion in the southeast?\u00a0 Here are 3 tips to ensure the best likelihood for success.<\/p><p>1. CHECK YOUR ASSUMPTIONS (AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS) AT THE DOOR<br \/>Ensure you put consistent process in place to guard against bias.\u00a0 Sounds simple enough right?<\/p><p>What happens when you don\u2019t recognize a candidate\u2019s university?\u00a0 How do you react when you hear a \u2018tang\u2019 in the way someone pronounces certain words? Are you projecting assumptions onto the candidate from across the Zoom?<\/p><p>After working for multiple tech startups in Nashville, I\u2019ve heard it all about the local talent pool. People here are \u201ctoo polite,\u201d slow to act, dripping in southern drawl, lacking \u201crelevant experience.\u201d These assumptions harm both employer and employee alike.<\/p><p>Also, take a look at how regional bias impacts your diversity and inclusion goals. The southeast is home to some of the most well renowned and prestigious HBCU\u2019s in America. Here we have metros like Memphis (where I grew up) with diverse and established Black American populations. Neglecting these locations may mean you are constraining your remote search to areas of the country with less of the\u00a0diversity needed to strengthen your company.<\/p><p>2. CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCENTIVES<br \/>The southeast boasts attractive grant opportunities and a relatively modest cost of living. Ensure you understand the landscape for employer and employee alike. Even if you only plan to make a modest number of hires in a certain remote region or state, you could be missing out on potential benefits available.<\/p><p>Before investing in hiring and recruitment, learn thoroughly about the partnerships and resources available to help. State, county, and chamber resources can provide guidance on grants and incentives available.\u00a0 Many regional universities have different programs available as well to help promote your company\u2019s presence to undergraduates and graduate students.<\/p><p>3. PLAN WITH PURPOSE<br \/>For all of the talk about the value of remote work in giving people opportunities to live anywhere, it\u2019s difficult to attract exceptional people in remote regions without a clear plan. Employee prospects want to understand your vision and objectives for hiring in their region, and the dependencies.\u00a0 Are you simply searching for people anywhere because your office is currently closed?\u00a0 Are you considering opening up a satellite office or temporary presence in another region?\u00a0 Do you plan to change you policies down the line to require people to live near headquarters?\u00a0 Be transparent and open in your communication at all times.\u00a0 This does not mean you need to have your hiring plan set in stone, or all of the specific details figured out.\u00a0 But it does mean you should at least have a roadmap.<\/p><p>Also, when planning, consider the wider range of benefits to concentrating your efforts on one or specific regions in the country. What does success look like? Aside from being able to access state grants that reduce your operating expenses, taking a geographical focus to your expansion can help you meet other business goals, including improving sales execution with personnel closer to your sales prospects, improving customer relationships with increased hours of operations, and achieving resiliency in the event that you decide to shut down your current headquarters.<\/p><p>Consider your vision for potential relocation opportunities for employees looking to move out from headquarters.\u00a0 You may want to get temporary or permanent office space, ensure you have a strong broker partner to guide your search efforts and give you a deep sense of the options available in the region.<\/p><p>TALENT EXPANSION \u2013 CLOSE<br \/>If you\u2019ve decided you want to focus on the southeast, that\u2019s great!
