Does bias about where to find talent today contribute to the challenges?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Brookings Institute Report<\/h5>\n<p>The Brookings Institute recently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/research\/growth-centers-how-to-spread-tech-innovation-across-america\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared findings<\/a> that will not surprise those familiar with the history of tech. \u201cInnovation jobs\u201d continue to concentrate in a small number of coastal hubs, including San Francisco, Seattle, and Boston. By contrast, 90% of U.S. metros have seen declining shares of tech employment, losing opportunities for economic development and growth.<\/p>\n<p>The Brookings Institute argues for federal intervention to promote \u201cgrowth centers\u201d across the country by encouraging workforce development and regulatory change. By helping regions elsewhere build out infrastructure, policymakers can spread out the benefits associated with a preference for concentration.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Talent is Distributed<\/h5>\n<p>Clearly, tech businesses see benefits in proximity to each other, including infrastructure and access to talent and capital. However, operating a business in a coastal hub is expensive. Given the higher costs, one would expect to see accelerated efforts to spread out into less expensive markets. The tech industry itself has done a lot to make collaboration easier across the globe. Why not look for access to exceptional talent at more affordable rates?<\/p>\n<p>In 2017, Kristen Chen and Julia Stefan <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/business\/talent\/blog\/talent-strategy\/best-us-cities-for-recruiting-sales-operations-and-engineers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published interesting findings<\/a> on the LinkedIn talent blog. Looking at data extracted from LinkedIn profiles, they found significant talent density, relative to demand, for sales and operations roles across the midwest and southeast. Their data suggested talent markets remain available widely across the country as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>Is something else at work limiting companies from pursuing talent beyond tech hubs?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Tech Hub Concentration and Unconscious Bias<\/h5>\n<p>In fact, untested hiring assumptions likely contribute to concentration as much as anything else. As Peter Cappelli has argued, hiring processes remain hindered by failures to measure results associated with talent acquisition efforts. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shrm.org\/resourcesandtools\/hr-topics\/talent-acquisition\/pages\/7-practical-ways-to-reduce-bias-in-your-hiring-process.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unconscious bias<\/a> is a significant issue in the tech industry. While many vendors promote technologies to solve the problem, others argue they could be inadvertently contributing to the problem.<\/p>\n<p>Even thought we often think about bias as operating within a given tech hub, it also influences perceptions of talent markets beyond it. In fact, a number of regions across the country offer high concentrations of individuals with backgrounds spanning functions and industry verticals, including women, veterans, ethnic minorities, and other non-traditional candidates with tremendous experience and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shrm.org\/resourcesandtools\/hr-topics\/talent-acquisition\/pages\/7-practical-ways-to-reduce-bias-in-your-hiring-process.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">soft skills that matter<\/a> most in today\u2019s economy. To assume that great talent for tech sits waiting to relocate is itself a reflection of bias towards candidates who may be younger, or not rooted to place by mortgage or family considerations \u2013 or, even worse, an unconscious preference for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-04-04\/how-americans-self-sort-themselves-by-age-and-class\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">those who come from greater socioeconomic privilege<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Defining Tech Workers Matter<\/h5>\n<p>Additionally, the way analysts define \u201ctech talent\u201d also contributes to the problem of tech concentration. Many analysts promote the notion that product and engineering skills denote a region\u2019s viability for a tech business. While presence of this talent remains critical, such assumptions overlook the value of sales and operations.<\/p>\n<p>For example, in a recent report on US Tech Talent, CRBE defines tech talent as &#8220;highly skilled technical workers who create and enable the software and devices that are integrated into nearly everything we do.&#8221; The report looks at multiple metrics to measure markets, including office vacancy and general population trends, but the authors acknowledge giving presence of tech talent the \u201chighest weights\u201d in their market assessments. Is this the best way to rank regions to support industry growth? As any veteran of tech can share, revenue, marketing, and business operations roles matter deeply in the innovation sector. Businesses and analysts need to look closely at how they define tech talent to assess the viability of regions across the country.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Talent Beyond Tech Hubs<\/h5>\n<p>Flattering as it might be to believe that exceptional talent can relocate easily, companies need to think more about expanding beyond tech hubs as a talent strategy in and of itself. And the process for selecting a location for headquarters or expansion, much like determining a process for hiring great people, needs to be inspected for bias. This is not merely for social good; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/carolinecastrillon\/2019\/03\/24\/why-women-led-companies-are-better-for-employees\/?sh=448404f53264\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">companies that achieve diversity of teams and leadership generally perform better<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The Brookings Institute paper makes a compelling case for national attention to the challenges posed by tech company concentration. Instead of waiting for the government to modify policy and make investments, companies should look closely at their assumptions today. Tremendous talent resides across America, and the best companies <a href=\"blog\/the-industry-insider-fallacy-in-sales-hiring\/\">think differently<\/a> about the opportunities to grow beyond tech hubs to secure it.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The convergence of tech in coastal hubs describe a big problem.

Companies have learned they can hire exceptional talent at reasonable salaries while reducing overhead. Employees, no longer faced with paying exorbitant rents to live near headquarters, now have options to relocate anywhere.<\/p><p>So what\u2019s the problem?<\/p><p>While great people resides everywhere,\u00a0much of the southeast get less attention due to preconceptions and bias.\u00a0 In fact, some regions here likely offer the most promising opportunities for responsible growth.<\/p><p>Interested in talent expansion in the southeast?\u00a0 Here are 3 tips to ensure the best likelihood for success.<\/p><p>1. CHECK YOUR ASSUMPTIONS (AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS) AT THE DOOR<br \/>Ensure you put consistent process in place to guard against bias.\u00a0 Sounds simple enough right?<\/p><p>What happens when you don\u2019t recognize a candidate\u2019s university?\u00a0 How do you react when you hear a \u2018tang\u2019 in the way someone pronounces certain words? Are you projecting assumptions onto the candidate from across the Zoom?<\/p><p>After working for multiple tech startups in Nashville, I\u2019ve heard it all about the local talent pool. People here are \u201ctoo polite,\u201d slow to act, dripping in southern drawl, lacking \u201crelevant experience.\u201d These assumptions harm both employer and employee alike.<\/p><p>Also, take a look at how regional bias impacts your diversity and inclusion goals. The southeast is home to some of the most well renowned and prestigious HBCU\u2019s in America. Here we have metros like Memphis (where I grew up) with diverse and established Black American populations. Neglecting these locations may mean you are constraining your remote search to areas of the country with less of the\u00a0diversity needed to strengthen your company.<\/p><p>2. CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCENTIVES<br \/>The southeast boasts attractive grant opportunities and a relatively modest cost of living. Ensure you understand the landscape for employer and employee alike. Even if you only plan to make a modest number of hires in a certain remote region or state, you could be missing out on potential benefits available.<\/p><p>Before investing in hiring and recruitment, learn thoroughly about the partnerships and resources available to help. State, county, and chamber resources can provide guidance on grants and incentives available.\u00a0 Many regional universities have different programs available as well to help promote your company\u2019s presence to undergraduates and graduate students.<\/p><p>3. PLAN WITH PURPOSE<br \/>For all of the talk about the value of remote work in giving people opportunities to live anywhere, it\u2019s difficult to attract exceptional people in remote regions without a clear plan. Employee prospects want to understand your vision and objectives for hiring in their region, and the dependencies.\u00a0 Are you simply searching for people anywhere because your office is currently closed?\u00a0 Are you considering opening up a satellite office or temporary presence in another region?\u00a0 Do you plan to change you policies down the line to require people to live near headquarters?\u00a0 Be transparent and open in your communication at all times.\u00a0 This does not mean you need to have your hiring plan set in stone, or all of the specific details figured out.\u00a0 But it does mean you should at least have a roadmap.<\/p><p>Also, when planning, consider the wider range of benefits to concentrating your efforts on one or specific regions in the country. What does success look like? Aside from being able to access state grants that reduce your operating expenses, taking a geographical focus to your expansion can help you meet other business goals, including improving sales execution with personnel closer to your sales prospects, improving customer relationships with increased hours of operations, and achieving resiliency in the event that you decide to shut down your current headquarters.<\/p><p>Consider your vision for potential relocation opportunities for employees looking to move out from headquarters.\u00a0 You may want to get temporary or permanent office space, ensure you have a strong broker partner to guide your search efforts and give you a deep sense of the options available in the region.<\/p><p>TALENT EXPANSION \u2013 CLOSE<br \/>If you\u2019ve decided you want to focus on the southeast, that\u2019s great!
